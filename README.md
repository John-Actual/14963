Hi all,
This is our code from the 2022 - 2023 season of the First Tech Challenge, PowerPlay. This code demonstrates common features of motor control and autonomous movement, and covers more advanced topics, such as OpenCV, AprilTags, and Multithreading. Feel free to browse this code and impliment in your own robots. Also make sure to check out previous commits for more new and different ideas.
Thanks :)
